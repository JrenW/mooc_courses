	<h1>Browser Sync is your Web Dev pal!</h1>

	<h2>What's Browser Sync? </h2>
	<p>Browser Sync does automatic <b> real-time synchronization </b>of your edits in your local script, be it html, css, or javascript, and updates webpage view once you 'save' the edited script.
	</p>
	<p><i>So you don't have to re-run entire script on browser every time!</i></p>

	<h2>How to get it working?</h2>
	<p>Once you have successfully installed Browser Sync, do the following:</p>

	<ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li><p>Navigate to your target directory in which you want Browser Sync to WATCH (i.e. to keep track and auto-sync); </p></li>
		<li>Open up your terminal and type this command line (Mac only): 
			<p><b>[ browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*" ]</b></p></li>
		<li><p>A Browser Sync webpage should pop up for you to visualize all folders/files in the target directory; </p></li>
		<li><p>Click on the file on the Broswer Sync page you would like to sync-view; </p></li>
		<li><p>Now you can edit scripts locally and view updates by SAVE your script and REFRESH the Broswer Sync page;</p></li>
		<li><p>Once you have finished editing, EXIT Broswer Sync by hitting <b> "Ctrl + C" </b> in the command line (Mac only); </p></li>
	</ol>
